# 🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE REPORT

## Current Situation (as of Wed Sep 17 02:59:55 PM UTC 2025)

### ❌ The deployment is NOT using the latest code

Despite multiple deployment attempts and a "clear build and cache" deployment, the service is still running OLD CODE.

## Evidence:

### 1. **CreditTransaction Reference Error STILL Present**
```
Error: "'reference_id' is an invalid keyword argument for CreditTransaction"
```
This error can ONLY come from old code trying to use `reference_id` instead of `stripe_payment_intent_id`.

### 2. **Git Repository Has The Fix**
```bash
# Line 640 in app/api/v1/endpoints/credits.py shows:
CreditTransaction.stripe_payment_intent_id == payment_id  # ✅ CORRECT
```

### 3. **Service Behavior**
- Onboarding status check: Shows `reference_id` error ❌
- Onboarding attempt: Fails with `'user_id'` error ❌
- Opportunity discovery: 0 opportunities (no strategies) ❌
- Execution time: 0.0ms (immediate exit) ❌

## Root Cause Analysis:

The deployed service is NOT running the code from the main branch. Possible reasons:

1. **Wrong Branch Deployed**: Service might be deployed from a different branch
2. **Build Cache Not Cleared**: Despite claiming cache was cleared, old image persists
3. **Wrong Deployment Source**: Render might be pulling from wrong repository/fork
4. **Environment Variable Issue**: `RENDER_GIT_BRANCH` might not be set to `main`

## Immediate Actions Required:

### 1. Verify Render Settings:
- Check which branch is configured for deployment
- Verify the GitHub repository URL is correct
- Check if auto-deploy is enabled for the main branch

### 2. Force Fresh Deployment:
```bash
# In Render dashboard:
1. Go to Settings > Build & Deploy
2. Verify "Branch" is set to "main"
3. Click "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Wait for "Deploy logs" to show completion
```

### 3. Verify Deployment Commit:
Look for this line in Render deploy logs:
```
Cloning from https://github.com/voicebootix/CryptoUniverse.git (commit: xxx)
```
The commit should be one of these recent fixes:
- `4fe59ae4` - Latest merge
- `e502eccb` - Signal extraction fix
- `d47d70e6` - CreditTransaction fix

## Expected Behavior After Correct Deployment:

1. ✅ No `reference_id` error
2. ✅ Successful onboarding for new users
3. ✅ Strategies provisioned
4. ✅ Opportunities discovered

## Current Status: 
**🔴 BLOCKED** - The service is running outdated code and cannot function properly until the correct code is deployed.
