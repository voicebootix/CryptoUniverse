# Unified Price Service Integration

## Overview
Created a unified price service to eliminate duplication between market analysis and exchange integration work streams.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: Two separate systems fetching USD prices:
- Market Analysis Service: Used CoinGecko, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, CoinCap
- Exchange Integration: Used Binance ticker API for portfolio valuation

**After**: Single unified service that intelligently routes price requests to optimal sources.

## Implementation

### New Service
**File**: `app/services/unified_price_service.py`
- Intelligent source routing based on use case
- Redis caching with appropriate TTL
- Fallback mechanisms between sources
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Health monitoring

### Integration Points

#### Market Analysis Integration
**File**: `app/api/v1/endpoints/trading.py:564-578`
- Market overview endpoint now uses unified service as fallback
- Maintains existing market analysis functionality
- Adds exchange data as backup source

#### Exchange Integration
**File**: `app/api/v1/endpoints/exchanges.py:779-781`
- Portfolio balance calculations use unified service
- Optimized for portfolio valuation accuracy
- Maintains existing exchange functionality

#### Startup Integration
**File**: `start.py:81-83`
- Unified service initialized on startup
- Proper initialization order maintained

### Smart Source Selection

#### Use Case Routing
- **Market Analysis**: Prefers market data sources (comprehensive)
- **Portfolio Valuation**: Prefers exchange sources (accurate)
- **General**: Auto-selects based on symbol and availability

#### Symbol-Based Routing
- **Major Coins** (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.): Market data preferred
- **Stablecoins** (USDT, USDC, etc.): Fixed $1.00 value
- **Other Assets**: Exchange data preferred

### Caching Strategy
- **Market Data**: 60-second TTL
- **Exchange Data**: 30-second TTL  
- **Stablecoins**: 1-hour TTL
- **Fallback Data**: 5-minute TTL

## Testing
**Endpoint**: `/api/v1/market/test/unified-prices`
- Tests all price sources
- Validates source selection logic
- Provides health status
- Compares results across sources

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates Duplication**: Single source for all USD price requests
2. **Improves Performance**: Intelligent caching and source selection
3. **Enhances Reliability**: Multiple fallback sources
4. **Optimizes API Usage**: Better rate limit management
5. **Maintains Functionality**: Both work streams continue to work as before

## Backward Compatibility
All existing functionality is preserved:
- Market analysis continues to work with enhanced data sources
- Exchange integration continues to work with unified price fetching
- No breaking changes to existing APIs or frontend components
