# CryptoUniverse System Design - Expected Behavior

## 🎯 What SHOULD Happen

### 1. Strategy Scanning
The user has 8 strategies (from the portfolio test):
- **3 FREE strategies** (auto-provisioned):
  - ai_risk_management
  - ai_portfolio_optimization  
  - ai_spot_momentum_strategy ✅ (only this one found opportunities)
- **1 PURCHASED strategy**:
  - ai_options_trade
- **4 OTHER strategies** shown in portfolio

**ISSUE**: Only spot momentum is finding opportunities. Other strategies should also be scanning!

### 2. Opportunity Display Structure
Should show opportunities grouped by strategy:

```
📊 AI MONEY MANAGER REPORT
Found 87 Total Opportunities across your strategies:

🚀 AI Spot Momentum (30 opportunities)
  High Confidence (3):
  • SUI - SELL signal (8/10) - Entry: $X, Target: $Y
  • HOLO - SELL signal (8/10) - Entry: $X, Target: $Y
  • FARTCOIN - SELL signal (8/10) - Entry: $X, Target: $Y
  
  Medium Confidence (16):
  • [List more...]

📈 AI Risk Management (15 opportunities)
  • [Defensive plays, hedging opportunities...]

💼 AI Portfolio Optimization (12 opportunities)
  • [Rebalancing suggestions...]

🎯 AI Options Trading (10 opportunities)
  • [Options strategies with Greeks...]

[Continue for all active strategies...]
```

### 3. AI Money Manager Recommendations Based on User Mode

**Conservative Mode:**
"Given your conservative profile, I recommend focusing on:
- Risk Management opportunities for capital preservation
- Low-volatility momentum plays (SUI, HOLO)
- Portfolio optimization for better diversification"

**Aggressive Mode:**
"For maximum growth potential:
- High signal strength momentum trades (8/10)
- Options strategies with favorable risk/reward
- Concentrated positions in top opportunities"

**Balanced Mode:**
"Balanced approach recommendation:
- Mix of momentum and mean reversion
- Moderate position sizes
- Equal weight to risk management"

## 🚨 Current Reality vs Expectation

### What's Working:
✅ 30 opportunities found (momentum only)
✅ Signal analysis and quality tiers
✅ 594 assets scanned

### What's NOT Working:
❌ Only 1 of 8 strategies scanning
❌ No grouped display by strategy
❌ No user mode consideration
❌ Generic AI responses
❌ Wrong symbols in chat

## 💡 The System Architecture IS Sophisticated!

It has:
- Multiple AI strategies
- User profiling
- Risk assessment
- Signal analysis
- Quality tiers
- Market scanning

But the PRESENTATION doesn't reflect this sophistication!
