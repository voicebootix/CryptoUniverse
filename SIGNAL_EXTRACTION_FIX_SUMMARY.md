# Signal Extraction Fix Summary

## ✅ The Claim Was 100% Correct!

### The Problem:
The opportunity scanner was looking for signal data in the wrong location:
- **Scanner expected**: `momentum_result.get("execution_result", {}).get("signal")`
- **Strategy returns**: `momentum_result.get("signal")` (at top level)

### Evidence from Code:

**Trading Strategy Response** (`trading_strategies.py` line 721-741):
```python
return {
    "success": True,
    "strategy": "momentum",
    "signal": {                    # ← Signal is HERE (top level)
        "action": action,
        "strength": signal_strength,
        "confidence": signal_strength * 10
    },
    "execution_result": execution_result,  # ← Sibling to signal, not parent
    "risk_management": {...}
}
```

**Scanner Code** (OLD - line 916-917):
```python
execution_result = momentum_result.get("execution_result", {})
signals = execution_result.get("signal")  # ← Looking in WRONG place!
```

### The Fix Applied:
```python
# NEW - Check top level first, with fallback for compatibility
signals = momentum_result.get("signal") or momentum_result.get("execution_result", {}).get("signal")
```

### Impact:
- **Before**: ALL momentum opportunities were skipped (signals = None)
- **After**: Momentum opportunities will now be discovered when signals exist
- **Added**: Debug logging to catch similar issues in production

### Deployment:
- **Commit**: `87f99dec`
- **Status**: Pushed to main, ready for deployment

## Summary of All Fixes Now in Place:
1. ✅ **Nullable fields handling** - Prevents TypeError with null values
2. ✅ **CreditTransaction query** - Fixed reference_id → stripe_payment_intent_id
3. ✅ **Signal extraction** - Fixed to look at correct location in response

Once deployed, the system should finally start discovering momentum opportunities!
