# Enterprise System Fixes Needed

## Current Issues

### 1. Options Trading - CRITICAL ❌
**Problem**: Looking for non-existent contracts with:
- Invalid strike price: 121446.45 (BTC is ~100k, not 121k)
- Past expiry date: 2024-12-27 (it's 2025 now!)
- Contract doesn't exist in the system

**Root Cause**: Options strategy is calculating strike prices incorrectly and using hardcoded past dates

### 2. Portfolio Optimization - No Opportunities
**Problem**: Returns 0 recommendations even though portfolio could be optimized
**Root Cause**: Too strict criteria or not enough portfolio imbalance

### 3. Risk Management - Only 2 Opportunities
**Problem**: Should find more risk mitigation needs in a portfolio
**Root Cause**: High urgency threshold (>0.6) filtering out many recommendations

### 4. Performance - 62 Second Response Time
**Problem**: Takes over a minute to scan opportunities
**Root Cause**: Sequential scanning of strategies instead of parallel

## Proper Enterprise Fixes

### Fix 1: Options Trading
```python
# Instead of invalid calculations, use:
- Current BTC price for base
- Future dates (30, 60, 90 days out)
- Realistic strike intervals ($1000 increments)
- Check contract availability before analysis
```

### Fix 2: Make ALL Strategies Generate Opportunities
```python
# Lower thresholds:
- Risk Management: urgency > 0.3 (not 0.6)
- Portfolio Optimization: improvement > 0.05 (not 0.1)
- Options: expected_edge > 2.0 (not 5.0)
```

### Fix 3: Parallel Strategy Scanning
```python
# Run all strategies in parallel:
tasks = [
    scan_momentum(),
    scan_risk_management(),
    scan_portfolio_optimization(),
    scan_options()
]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### Fix 4: Proper Chat Presentation
- Group by strategy
- Show actionable insights
- Include entry/exit prices
- Display according to user risk mode
