ðŸŽ¯ TARGETED QUERY OPTIMIZATION
Based on actual Supabase usage data from production

Your real performance issues:
1. exchange_accounts: 2,108 index scans (super hot!)
2. exchange_api_keys: 1,137 index scans  
3. exchange_balances: 919 index scans
4. user_sessions: 73 rows but very active

NOT data volume - you have tiny tables!

ðŸŽ¯ PERFORMANCE TIPS BASED ON YOUR DATA:

1. **Batch Operations**: You're doing too many single-row queries
   - Instead of N queries for N accounts, use 1 JOIN query
   
2. **Filter Early**: Add WHERE clauses for common filters
   - status = 'ACTIVE' 
   - trading_enabled = true
   - total_balance > 0
   
3. **Limit Results**: You probably don't need all 73 user sessions
   - Add LIMIT clauses
   - Order by most recent first
   
4. **Use Partial Indexes**: For boolean filters (is_active = true)
   - Smaller indexes
   - Faster lookups
   
5. **Connection Pooling**: With only 8 users, you're likely opening too many connections
   - Set max_connections = 5 in your app
   - Use connection pooling properly
