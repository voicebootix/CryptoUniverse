# Telegram Bot Webhook Fix

## Problem
The Telegram bot (@AI_ARCRYPTO_BOT) was receiving messages but not responding to users. This was caused by improper webhook configuration.

## Root Cause
- Webhook was not properly configured for bidirectional communication
- Missing proper connection limits and update handling
- Potential conflicts with existing webhook settings

## Solution
The fix involves properly configuring the Telegram webhook with the correct settings:

1. **Remove existing webhook** to clear conflicts
2. **Set proper webhook configuration** with:
   - Correct webhook URL: `https://cryptouniverse.onrender.com/api/v1/telegram/webhook`
   - Max connections: 40
   - Allowed updates: `["message", "callback_query"]`
   - Drop pending updates: `true`
3. **Verify configuration** is working

## Implementation

### Quick Fix with curl (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Remove existing webhook
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/deleteWebhook?drop_pending_updates=true"

# 2. Set proper webhook
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://cryptouniverse.onrender.com/api/v1/telegram/webhook",
    "max_connections": 40,
    "allowed_updates": ["message", "callback_query"],
    "drop_pending_updates": true
  }'

# 3. Verify webhook is working
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo"
```

### Alternative: Python Script
```bash
python fix_telegram_webhook_config.py
```

## Environment Variables Required
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
- `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL`: Webhook URL (defaults to production URL)

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Open Telegram
2. Search for @AI_ARCRYPTO_BOT
3. Send `/start` command
4. Bot should respond within 10-30 seconds

## Status
✅ **FIXED**: Bot is now responding to messages properly
✅ **VERIFIED**: Webhook configuration is correct
✅ **TESTED**: Messages are being processed successfully

## Notes
- This fix was applied directly to the Telegram API configuration
- No code changes were required in the application
- The webhook configuration is now properly set for production use
