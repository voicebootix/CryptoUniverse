## üö® Critical Monitoring Gaps (What's Missing)

### 1. **AI System Performance** ‚ùå NOT MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- AI model response times per provider (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Token usage and costs per conversation
- AI consensus decision quality and confidence scores
- Chat memory hit rates and context retention
- AI model failure rates and fallback triggers

**Why critical:**
- AI calls are expensive (GPT-4: ~$0.03/1K tokens)
- Slow AI responses degrade user experience
- Failed AI calls break core features

### 2. **Signal Intelligence Metrics** ‚ùå NOT MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- Signal generation latency (time from market event to signal)
- Signal delivery success rates (Telegram, Email, WebSocket)
- Signal performance tracking (win rate, P&L, Sharpe ratio)
- Signal subscription analytics (active subscribers, churn)
- Signal quality scores and confidence intervals

**Why critical:**
- Delayed signals = missed trades = angry users
- Failed signal delivery = revenue loss
- Poor signal performance = user churn

### 3. **Trading Execution Monitoring** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- Order execution latency (time from signal to fill)
- Slippage metrics (expected vs actual price)
- Order rejection rates per exchange
- Trade success/failure rates
- Position sizing accuracy
- Paper trading vs live mode divergence

**Why critical:**
- Slow execution = slippage = user losses
- Failed orders break automation
- Execution issues are the #1 user complaint

### 4. **Market Data Quality** ‚ùå NOT MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- Data feed latency per exchange
- WebSocket connection uptime
- Price data staleness (last update timestamp)
- Data gaps and missing candles
- Exchange API response times

**Why critical:**
- Stale data = bad signals = user losses
- Data gaps break backtests
- Slow feeds cause missed opportunities

### 5. **Risk System Health** ‚ùå NOT MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- Risk calculation latency
- Portfolio risk scores distribution
- Position limit breaches
- Correlation matrix staleness
- Stress test execution times

**Why critical:**
- Risk limits protect users from ruin
- Slow risk calcs delay trading
- Missed risk alerts = potential disasters

### 6. **Credit System & Economics** ‚ö†Ô∏è BASIC TRACKING
**What needs tracking:**
- Credit transaction throughput
- Credit balance anomalies (negative balances, overflow)
- Payment processing success rates
- Profit sharing distribution accuracy
- Revenue per user metrics

**Why critical:**
- Credit bugs = revenue loss
- Payment failures = user complaints
- Economics drive business viability

### 7. **Strategy Performance & Marketplace** ‚ùå NOT MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- Active strategies per user
- Strategy execution success rates
- Marketplace strategy downloads/activations
- Strategy submission queue depth
- Strategy testing completion times

**Why critical:**
- Strategy failures break core value prop
- Slow strategy testing delays time-to-market
- Marketplace metrics drive growth

### 8. **API Cost Tracking** ‚úÖ EXISTS BUT NOT EXPOSED
**What needs exposure:**
- Real-time cost per user
- Cost breakdown by provider (AI, Exchanges, Data)
- Cost anomalies and spikes
- Cost forecasting and budgets
- Per-feature cost attribution

**Why critical:**
- Runaway costs kill profitability
- Cost-per-user informs pricing
- Anomaly detection prevents overruns

### 9. **Emergency & Incident Response** ‚ùå NOT MONITORED
**What needs tracking:**
- Emergency manager activation count
- Circuit breaker trips
- Failover events
- Service degradation alerts
- Recovery time metrics

**Why critical:**
- Incidents need fast response
- Circuit breakers protect system
- Recovery metrics show reliability

### 10. **Resource Utilization** ‚ö†Ô∏è BASIC TRACKING
**What needs tracking:**
- Redis memory usage and eviction rates
- Database connection pool stats
- CPU/Memory per service
- Network bandwidth usage
- Background task queue depths

**Why critical:**
- Resource exhaustion causes outages
- Memory leaks degrade performance
- Queue backlogs indicate bottlenecks
