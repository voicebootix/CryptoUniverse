## Key Observations:

1. **MarketAnalysisService is active** - Successfully discovering options and futures contracts
2. **Multiple duplicate requests** - Same operations being repeated (e.g., bybit options discovery 3 times)
3. **High response times** - 5.5-6.9 seconds for market analysis requests
4. **user_id=system** - These are system-level requests, not user-initiated
5. **Successful discovery** - Finding 500+ contracts on multiple exchanges

## What's Missing:

1. No logs from `UserOpportunityDiscoveryService`
2. No logs showing strategy scanning
3. No error logs about nullable fields or exceptions
4. No logs about user authentication or strategy loading

## Hypothesis:

The issue might be that:
1. User strategies are not being loaded from Redis (as we suspected earlier)
2. The opportunity discovery is failing before it even gets to the scanning phase
3. The `execution_time_ms: 0.0` suggests the discovery process is exiting early
